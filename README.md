# Group 3 Assignment 11 - Friends

Hello! This project is a website dedicated to the show Friends. 

The main challenge we faced in building this site was when two people tried to commit changes at the same time. GitHub did not seem to like that very much, and some of the code between the two commits must have contradicted, because we lost both of the commits entirely, and in fact GitHub deleted one of the existing files that was being edited on the main. We eventually fixed this over a Slack huddle, and things mostly went smoothly from there. Additionally, some of us were committing changes on the main rather than on separate branches, but we figured out how to pull the main to our terminals, create branches and push them properly.
