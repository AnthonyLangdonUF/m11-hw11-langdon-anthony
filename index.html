        <h1>Oh My God! Could This BE Any More About "Friends"?</h1>
        <p> Welcome to the world where coffee doesn’t sleep, and neither do the laughs. "Friends," the show that taught us that it’s totally okay to eat a floor cheesecake and that "PIVOT" isn’t just a fancy term for dancers. For ten seasons, Monica, Ross, Rachel, Joey, Chandler, and Phoebe navigated the tricky waters of life, love, and late rent in New York City, giving us some of the most memorable moments and one-liners in TV history. Whether you’re here because you heard about the show from a friend or you’ve been a fan since you could spell 'transponster,' there’s always something new to catch up on with our six favorite pals.<p>
